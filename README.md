A correlational study between the factors of US presidential speeches and fluctuations in the S&P 500 index using machine learning and econometric methods

This is a working research project in persuit of my masters degree in economics. 

I am performing text data collection, cleaning, sentiment analysis and text vectorisation through Python methods. 

Feature extraction on financial data is performed in R using econometric methods. 

Data piping and machine learning will be completed in Python. The main script is a Python script that can call R code. 

The core concern of this project is my education in financial analysis, natural language processing and machine learning.
