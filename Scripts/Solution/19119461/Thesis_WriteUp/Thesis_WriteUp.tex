\small{
The literature relating textual to stock market data is deep but
research into the relationship between speeches given by presidents and
stock markets is lacking. This paper begins to fill this gap by
exploring the relationship between U.S. presidential speeches and daily
price movements in the S\&P 500 index. It was possible to explore this
relationship by using natural language processing techniques,
econometric time-series analysis and machine learning models. It was
found that models including presidential speech data can achieve
prediction accuracy of about 60\% over S\&P 500 index price movements.
This is an increase of about 1 percentage point over the models that did
not include the presidential speech data (without losing ground in
either recall or precision). Thus it is concluded that presidential
speeches hold predictive power over stock market movements and that this
relationship can be used to improve the power of predictive models.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Introduction
\label{Introduction}}{Introduction }}\label{introduction}}

The efficient market hypothesis states that the history of a market is
an ineffective predictor of its future, nonetheless there are many
iterations of attempts to predict markets based on their own histories
and external factors (\protect\hyperlink{ref-famaEfficient}{Fama,
1965}). Moore's law states that computing power doubles every two years
and although this is not strictly true, the lived experience is close
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mollick2006establishing}{Mollick, 2006}). This
combined with the onset of massive amounts of publicly available data
has given empirical research in the social sciences power that it has
never been able to muster until recent years. Computer driven analysis
of large amounts of text data is rapidly becoming mainstream and
specifically, political text data is one external factor useful in
predicting market futures
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-grimmer2013text}{Grimmer \& Stewart, 2013};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hayo2008communicating}{Hayo, Kutan \& Neuenkirch,
2008}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-maligkris2017political}{Maligkris, 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-soroka2015bad}{Soroka, Young \& Balmas, 2015}).

Hayo \emph{et al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hayo2008communicating}{2008})
performed a generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedastic
(GARCH) analysis of the relationship between Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) speeches and the U.S. financial market. The analysis
was quantitative on the market side and qualitative on the speech side
and demonstrates that the sentiments of communications influence the
effect of those communications on markets. Thus, analyzing sentiment is
an important factor in an accurate appraisal of the relationship between
speeches and markets. Using regression analysis Maligkris
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-maligkris2017political}{2017}) demonstrate that
there is a correlation between presidential candidates' speeches and
stock movements. Further, they indicate that speeches laden with
economic information tend to boost stock returns while also reducing
volatility while speeches with a negative tone have the opposite effect
and the long run effect of speeches is dependent on market conditions.
Baker, Bloom \& Davis (\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker2016measuring}{2016})
show that language processing can be used to predict economic events,
and particularly economic uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty.
They develop an Economic Policy Uncertainty Index based on the frequency
of articles containing a trio of terms in 10 leading U.S. newspapers.
The terms were selected over a period of 24 months during which more
than 15 000 news articles were read by humans in an auditing process.
The index proved to be quite accurate, spiking near the expected events,
including wars, tight presidential elections, fiscal policy battles and
terrorist activity. Sazedj \& Tavares
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sazedj2011hope}{2011}) highlight the
relationship between the content of a presidential speech and stock
market returns by regressing the event of a speech during Obama's first
11 months as U.S. president on the daily excess returns of the Dow
Jones, the S\&P 500 and the NASDAQ indices. They found that the event of
a speech had a generally insignificant effect on daily excesses.
However, by regressing key terms contained in 43 speeches given during
the first 11 months of Obama's presidency it was found that the content
of speeches can significantly affect daily excess returns nearly
uniformly across all three indices. Notably, the NASDAQ's correlation to
the content of speeches was weaker -- indicating that technology markets
may be less susceptible to presidential rhetoric.

The aim of this project is to determine whether U.S presidential
speeches have predictive power over U.S. stock market movements. A
positive result would be powerful and could add to the ability of
traders to accurately predict stock market movements. The undertaking of
this project assumes two important conjectures - both of which have been
confirmed by the research reported above. First, that there is a
correlation between the linguistic factors\footnote{`Linguistic factors'
  in this sense is intended to mean any and all patterns that can be
  detected in spoken language including verbiage, lexicon, tone,
  register, sentence length, word combination etc.} of speech employed
by U.S. presidents in their speeches and U.S. stock market movements;
and second, that the prominence of speech factors can be quantified by
using machine learning algorithms. Broadly, machine learning has been
selected as the method of modelling and the S\&P 500 index has been
chosen as representative of the `stock market'. As far as I am aware,
this research is novel.

In specific, this project shows that U.S. Presidential Speeches have
predictive power over S\&P 500 price fluctuations. In order to prove
this, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML) and time
series analysis were used. The usage of these 3 methods allowed for the
comparison of models based on purely financial data with models based on
a combination of financial and language data. The result being that the
best models based on a combination of financial and language data
outperformed the best purely financial models by about 1 percentage
point in terms of predictive accuracy at a daily resolution.

\hypertarget{methodology-review}{%
\section{Methodology review}\label{methodology-review}}

In order to select the methods most applicable to this project a review
of similar projects was undertaken. Seven papers are reviewed here in
order to elucidate commonly used methods in data cleaning, sentiment
analysis and stock market prediction. The results are summarized in two
tables following the review. Table \ref{Table 1} represents the
literature review in a condensed format which allows for easy comparison
of the data and methods used and resulting accuracies. Table
\ref{Table 2} represents the metadata, linked through `Paper number' for
Table \ref{Table 1}.

\hypertarget{data-cleaning-methods-for-nlp}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Data cleaning methods for NLP
\label{data cleaning}}{Data cleaning methods for NLP }}\label{data-cleaning-methods-for-nlp}}

Katre (\protect\hyperlink{ref-katre2019nlp}{2019}), in his analysis of
Indian political speeches, uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
package and string methods to remove punctuation, HTML tags and English
stopwords\footnote{`Stopwords' are words that commonly occur across all
  speech and therefore only create noise in the data. Some examples are
  `the', `it', `they' and `and'.}, as well as converting speeches to
lowercase and tokenizing\footnote{`Tokenizing' refers to the splitting
  of words into tokens that have linguistic importance, for example the
  words `terrorism', `terrorist' and `terror' may all be tokenized to
  `terror'. Thus, the core concept of the word is captured while also
  simplifying the dataset.} them. Zubair \& Cios
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-zubair2015extracting}{2015}), before correlating
the sentiment in Reuters articles with S\&P 500 movements, clean their
text data by tokenizing it with NLTK. Kinyua, Mutigwe, Cushing \& Poggi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kinyua2021analysis}{2021}) clean their Twitter
data (tweets from then U.S. president, Donald Trump) by deleting all
tweets on days when the stock trading was closed, deleting all tweets
that only contained standard stopwords and deleting all tweets that only
contained URLs. Khedr, Yaseen \& others
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-khedr2017predicting}{2017}) tokenize,
standardize by converting to lowercase, remove stopwords from and
stem\footnote{`Stemming' refers to the removal of suffixes to reduce the
  complexity of a dataset.} their textual data before processing the
abbreviations (replacing abbreviations with the full phrase) and
filtering out words that consist of two or less characters.

\hypertarget{machine-learning-methods}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Machine learning methods
\label{ML}}{Machine learning methods }}\label{machine-learning-methods}}

The following section looks first at the literature informing the
sentiment analysis space and then at the literature around stock market
prediction in order to determine methods that suit the intersection
between the two.

\hypertarget{sentiment-analysis-methods}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Sentiment analysis methods
\label{sentAnal}}{Sentiment analysis methods }}\label{sentiment-analysis-methods}}

Ren, Wu \& Liu (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ren2018forecasting}{2018})
analyse news articles at the sentence level by assigning a sentiment
polarity (using software designed for the Chinese language) to each word
followed by a sentiment score for each sentence in a document. Each
document is then categorized and a sentiment score between -1 and 1 for
all news for each day is generated. Zubair \& Cios
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-zubair2015extracting}{2015}) use the positive
and negative valence categories from the Harvard General Enquirer (HGI)
to assign each word in a Reuters news article a positive or negative
label. They then sum the positives and negatives into a tuple and divide
that tuple by the number of words in an article in order to create a
vector that represents each news article. The vectors are organized into
time series, normalized by dividing all vectors by the first vector,
parsed through a Kalman filter and then correlated to S\&P 500 returns
using Pearson correlation (for both the positive and negative scalar in
the vector). Kinyua \emph{et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kinyua2021analysis}{2021}) use the Valence Aware
Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) to create a sentiment feature
for former U.S. president Donald Trump's tweets which was then used as a
regression feature in linear, decision tree and random forest
regressions. Khedr \emph{et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-khedr2017predicting}{2017}) use N-gram (n=2) to
extract key phrases from their corpus of news text data, then
term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) is used to determine
the importance of those phrases within the corpus, and finally use a
naÃ¯ve-Bayes classifier to assign positive and negative labels to each
news document. Purevdagva, Zhao, Huang \& Mahoney
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-purevdagva2020machine}{2020}) use a variety of
features present in both data and metadata to predict fake political
speech. Two features relevant to this project were `speaker job' and
`context' (press, direct or social) which were labelled using universal
serial encoders. For the actual sentiment analysis they used the
linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) tool to categorize and count
words into emotional, cognitive and structural text components. Various
further attempts to extract sentiment from the text did not yield
increased prediction accuracies. They go on to use an extra tree
classifier for feature selection and then support vector machine (SVM),
multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network (CNN), decision
trees, fasttext and bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) for prediction with the highest accuracy resulting
from the SVM. Dilai, Onukevych \& Dilai
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dilaisentiment}{2021}) use SentiStrength -- an
automatic sentiment analysis tool - to compare the sentiment in speeches
between former U.S. president Donald Trump and former Ukrainian
president Petro Poroshenko.

\hypertarget{stock-market-prediction-methods}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Stock market prediction methods
\label{stockPred}}{Stock market prediction methods }}\label{stock-market-prediction-methods}}

Ren \emph{et al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ren2018forecasting}{2018}) use
an SVM and five-fold cross validation approach to achieve a prediction
accuracy of 98\% when predicting fake news in political speech. They
combined sentiment data and market indicators as their input data.
Kinyua \emph{et al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kinyua2021analysis}{2021})
use linear, decision tree and random forest regressions to predict S\&P
500 and DJIA directional changes. Random forest regression performed
best for both datasets. Khedr \emph{et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-khedr2017predicting}{2017}) use open, high, low
and close (OHLC) prices and the first lag of directional change as
features for prediction of future market trends. Jiao \& Jakubowicz
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-jiao2017predicting}{2017}) extracted lag and
window features from the S\&P 500 and the global 8 index before running
time series random forest, neural network and gradient boosted trees to
predict movements of individual stocks in the S\&P 500. Liu, Wang, Xiao
\& Liang (\protect\hyperlink{ref-liu2016forecasting}{2016}) used forward
search feature selection to select features for SVM, naÃ¯ve-Bayes,
Gaussian discriminant analysis and logistic regression from a set of
economic features including the crude oil daily return, currency
exchange rates and major stock indices daily returns in order to
forecast the S\&P 500 movement.

\section{Data collection and cleaning
process}\label{data-collection-and-cleaning-process}}

This section describes the data collection and cleaning process as well
as the feature extraction process. It begins by explaining the three
data-subset collected for this study, namely: control, meta and test
data. Control refers to auto-regressive features extracted from the S\&P
500, meta refers to S\&P 500 adjacent financial data and test refers to
vectorised presidential speeches - which are the focus of this study.
The section begins by elaborating on the collection and cleaning steps
for each of these datasets. The next subsection describes the feature
engineering methods (sentiment analysis and word vectorization) that
were used to extract variables with potentially strong signals from the
text data. The final subsection describes the reasoning, methods and
results used in a time series analysis of the financial time series
(S\&P 500) data in order to extract useable auto-regressive features
from it for the control data-subset.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

Three types of data were gathered for this project, namely: presidential
speeches/text data (all the transcripts from the Presidency Project
website including formal and informal and written and verbal addresses),
a history of the S\&P 500 index and a history of 5 S\&P 500 adjacent
price histories -- i.e.~2 subsets of financial data.

The S\&P 500 index and the metadata was downloaded from Yahoo Finance
while the presidential speeches were scraped from the American
Presidency Project (\protect\hyperlink{ref-yahooSP500}{Yahoo, n.d.})
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-americanPresProj1}{Woolley \& Peters, n.d}). The
S\&P 500 is downloaded using the `fin\_data\_downloader' Python module
and will always download the entire history of the S\&P 500 index at a
daily interval \footnote{All code used in this project can be found on
  my Github profile at github.com/PabloRees/Masters}. The same goes for
the metadata. The presidential speeches on the other hand were scraped
using the `WebScrapeAndClean' Python module which will also always
scrape the entire corpus available on the American Presidency Project
website. This allows for perfectly updated data to be collected at any
time.

The S\&P 500 data contains seven variables, namely: `Date', `Open',
`High', `Low', `Close', `Adj Close', and `Volume'. `Open' records the
opening price for each day, while `Close' records the closing price.
`High' records the daily high and `Low' the daily low. `Volume' records
the dollar amount of stock traded in the S\&P 500 on each day and `Adj
Close' is irrelevant because it never differs from `Close'. Notably,
opening and closing prices are only differentiated between after April
20th 1982 while volume was only recorded after 1950.

After scraping, the Presidency Project data contains five variables.
These are `Type' which records the category and sub-category of each
speech, `Name' which records the title and name of the main speaker,
`Date' which records the date the speech occurred on, `Title' which
records the title of each speech and `Transcript' which contains the raw
HTML transcript of the speech.

\hypertarget{cleaning}{%
\subsection{Cleaning}\label{cleaning}}

The S\&P 500 index did not require any cleaning after download, besides
the removal of the redundant `Adj Close' variable. Conversely, the
presidential speeches required extensive cleaning. Text that has been
web-scraped contains HTML tags\footnote{HTML tags include paragraphing
  and spacing indicators for computers to interpret such as
  `\textless p\textgreater{}' and `\textless/p\textgreater{}'.}, thus
the first step was to remove the HTML tags from the text. Similarly, the
test contained reactions from the crowds listening to the
speeches\footnote{These were tags such as
  `\textless em\textgreater Laughter\textless/em\textgreater{}' and
  `\textless em\textgreater Applause\textless/em\textgreater{}'.}, which
were also removed. Next, the transcripts were converted to lower case
and the question sections removed. Next a `No Stops Transcript' variable
was created by removing the stopwords\footnote{Stopwords are words that
  commonly occur in the English language and are therefore unlikely to
  contain any sort of signal and thus constitute only noise.} in the
Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) stop words dictionary from the clean
transcript. The original transcripts were also kept. The cleaning of the
speech data and both financial data-subsets was done in their original
collection modules, i.e.~the `fin\_data\_downloader' Python modules and
the `WebScrapeAndClean' Python modules respectively.

\hypertarget{text-feature-engineering}{%
\subsection{Text feature engineering}\label{text-feature-engineering}}

To increase the strength of the signals coming out of the speech data
and reduce the computational power required to run the machine learning
algorithms -- feature engineering is required. Feature engineering
refers to the emphasis of certain signals within the available data and
creation of new variables which capture these signals. It results in the
addition of extra features (variables) to the dataset. There are three
broad methods of feature engineering: feature selection, feature
extraction and the creation of new features
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-geron2019hands}{GÃ©ron, 2019: 27}). In this
section the creation of new features occurred and took the form of
sentiment analysis and vectorization via word embedding for the text
data.

\hypertarget{sentiment-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Sentiment analysis}\label{sentiment-analysis}}

Two versions of sentiment analysis were carried out. First, NLTK's
Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) was used to
extract a sentiment analysis tuple, in this instance containing four
scores, namely, negativity, neutrality, positivity and compound. VADER
is a lexicon based system of sentiment analysis
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sohangir2018financial}{Sohangir, Petty \& Wang,
2018}). Each of negativity, neutrality and positivity describe a
transcript independently of the other scores while compound describes a
transcript comprehensively (combining the other three scores). VADER,
when compared with alternative NLP feature extraction techniques has
performed better on social media transcripts and generalized better to
other areas Elbagir \& Yang
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elbagir2019twitter}{2019}). VADER has been used
in sentiment extraction from text relative to financial data in Pano \&
Kashef (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pano2020complete}{2020}) for Bitcoin
price predictions, Agarwal
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-agarwal2020sentiment}{2020}) which found a
strong correlation between VADER sentiment scores and stock price
changes and Sohangir \emph{et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sohangir2018financial}{2018}) which shows the
superiority of lexicon based approaches (specifically VADER) over ML
approaches for sentiment classification.

Next, the TextBlob package's sentiment analysis tool was used. This
yields two scores (in a tuple) describing the sentiment of a transcript,
namely, a polarity score (ranging from -1 to 1) and a subjectivity score
(ranging from 0 to 1). Polarity describes whether the emotions expressed
are negative or positive, with lower scores indicating negativity while
subjectivity indicates the extent of the usage of subjective words
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-loria2018textblob}{Loria \& others, 2018}).
Biswas, Sarkar, Das, Bose \& Roy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-biswas2020examining}{2020}) use TextBlob
sentiment scores in their analysis of the effects of Covid-19 on stock
markets. TextBlob was also tested in Sohangir \emph{et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sohangir2018financial}{2018}) but did not
perform as well as VADER although it did outperform ML methods in terms
of area under the curve (AUC) scores. Given the superior performance of
VADER in other projects it was expected that VADER's sentiment tuple
would outperform TextBlob's sentiment tuple as a predictor of the S\&P
500 data. The results explained in section \ref{results} show that this
expectation was correct.

\hypertarget{speech-vectorization}{%
\subsubsection{Speech vectorization}\label{speech-vectorization}}

Converting human readable text into machine readable data requires the
conversion from words to numbers. This vectorization can be done in
various ways but in order to preserve the meaning of the texts the
Word2Vec and Doc2Vec Python packages provided by Gensim were used
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rehurek2011gensim}{Rehurek \& Sojka, 2011}).
However, Word2Vec was not originally designed by Gensim, but rather by
Mikolov, Chen, Corrado \& Dean
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mikolov2013efficient}{2013}) and Mikolov,
Sutskever, Chen, Corrado \& Dean
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mikolov2013distributed}{2013}) while Doc2Vec was
suggested by Le \& Mikolov
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-le2014distributed}{2014}).

\hypertarget{word2vec}{%
\paragraph{Word2Vec}\label{word2vec}}

Gensim's Word2Vec Python package's skip-gram model is used for Word2Vec
vectorization. Using the full vocabulary of words in a corpus of
speeches and one-hot encoding for word vectors, Word2Vec trains a single
hidden layer neural network to predict words based on the words around
them. The parameters used for training are available in Appendix A.

The model contextually embeds each word in the entire corpus of speeches
by running the speeches through a single hidden layer predictive neural
network (NN). The NN is provided with the pseudo-task of predicting the
word of focus from the words surrounding it each time it occurs in the
corpus. Thus, a hidden layer is trained to contain the information that
contextually embeds each word in the corpus. These hidden layer vectors
(rather than the predictions) are the real output of the Word2Vec model.
Words that appear in similar contexts throughout the corpus will have
similar representational vectors (hidden layers) and thus can be said to
have similar meanings in the corpus Mikolov, Sutskever, \emph{et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mikolov2013distributed}{2013}).

An example phrase might be `The quick brown fox jumps'. If the word
`brown' is the focus word, the words `quick' and `fox' would be fed into
the NN which would then be trained to map the input to the word `brown'.
Doing this for every instance of `brown' in a corpus creates a hidden
layer that contains all the contextual information required to predict
the word `brown' in the given corpus. Figure \ref{Figure1} depicts this
process.

The model is extremely good at relating words that appear in similar
contexts to each other. For example, when asked for the three words most
similar to `oil' the model trained on the presidential speeches corpus
returns `crude', `gas' and `petroleum'. The input `gold' returns
`silver', `bullion' and `coin'; whilst `virus' returns `covid19',
`infection' and `pandemic'.

In this study the representational vectors each contain 200 elements
(because the hidden layers were set to contain 200 elements). The size
of the vector was set to 200 because of precedent set by Vargas, De Lima
\& Evsukoff (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vargas2017deep}{2017}), however
there is little consensus on the dimensions of word embedding vectors
that should be used and most researchers use a vector size between 50
and 300 (\protect\hyperlink{ref-patel-bhattacharyya-2017-towards}{Patel
\& Bhattacharyya, 2017}). However, this is an avenue that warrants
further research. Thus each word is described by a vector containing 200
elements. In order to create a similarly sized vector for each speech,
the vectors describing all the words in each speech were averaged. Thus,
each speech has been reduced to a 200 element vector averaging the
contextual embeddings of each word contained therein. This averaging
technique was also used in Vargas \emph{et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vargas2017deep}{2017}) and Qin
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-qin230natural}{2018}). However, this method
fails to preserve word order in a document vector
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-le2014distributed}{Le \& Mikolov, 2014}).

Notably, the algorithm also makes room for two-word phrases such as
`asset backed' or `short selling' -- which are considered as
`assetbacked' and `shortselling'. When two words that occur irregularly
in the vocabulary occur together frequently the algorithm interprets
them as a phrase and treats them as such. There is, however, only room
for two words in each phrase if the algorithm has only been executed
once -- which is the case here.

Word2vec is used by (\protect\hyperlink{ref-shi2019word2vec}{Shi, Zhao
\& Xu, 2019}) for the improvement of sentiment classification which
implies that the final vectors in this study may contain sentiment
information. It is also used by Vargas \emph{et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vargas2017deep}{2017}) and Qin
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-qin230natural}{2018}) in their predictive
modelling of S\&P 500 changes based on Twitter data. Vargas \emph{et
al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vargas2017deep}{2017}) also used 200
element vectors while Qin (\protect\hyperlink{ref-qin230natural}{2018})
used 300 element vectors. Both studies achieved prediction accuracy
around 65\%.

\hypertarget{doc2vec}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Doc2Vec
\label{Doc2Vec}}{Doc2Vec }}\label{doc2vec}}

An alternative method to creating a vector representation of a sentence
or document is Doc2Vec. This method is similar to the Word2Vec method
described above but includes an additional floating vector when
performing its pseudo-task. This vector is maintained across every word
prediction task within a document and subjected to training for each
instance of every word. Thus each document in a corpus is assigned a
single comprehensive vector that embeds it in the corpus. Embedding
within the broader corpus is maintained by tagging each document with a
unique tagging phrase. This method outperforms other methods such as
bag-of-words for text representations
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-le2014distributed}{Le \& Mikolov, 2014}).

There are two implementations of Doc2Vec, namely Distributed Bag of
Words (DBOW) and Distributed Memory (DM)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sohangir2018financial}{Sohangir \emph{et al.},
2018}). Both have been used in this study. In both cases each document
is assigned a paragraph tag which represents the paragraph to the
Doc2Vec algorithm. DM Doc2vec does this in the same way that a word
represents itself to the Word2Vec algorithm. For every word in a
document, its paragraph tag is passed to the Doc2Vec algorithm along
with the words relevant to the current prediction pseudo-task. Back
propagation is employed in the same manner as in Word2Vec except that
the document tag vector is optimized for separately from the word
vectors. This document tag vector is the relevant output in this case.
Because a single vector of weights is created for each document, this
vector should constitute a vectorized representation of the document as
a whole. Figure \ref{Figure2} depicts the architecture of DM Doc2Vec
algorithms. Alternatively, DBOW Doc2Vec algorithms ignore the context of
a word and use random sampling to predict words from a paragraph. Figure
\ref{Figure3} depicts the architecture of a DBOW Doc2Vec algorithm.

Only one example of the use of Word2Vec for financial prediction could
be found. Rashid \& Leon
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rashid2019making}{2019}) studies the possibility
of predicting closing prices of 4 major private technology companies'
and 3 major government contracted companies' stocks based on tweets from
then U.S. president, Donald Trump. Backtesting a trading model based on
the stock price predictions of a 4 layer NN using Doc2Vec data as input
yielded fair portfolio gains for the government contracted companies'
stocks but almost no change in portfolio values for the private
technology companies' stocks.

\hypertarget{sp-500-time-series-analysis}{%
\subsection{S\&P 500 time series
analysis}\label{sp-500-time-series-analysis}}

As part of feature extraction - econometric time series analysis was run
on the S\&P 500 data. The aim of this analysis was to find the linear
model of best fit to the S\&P 500 data and then include relevant
auto-regressive variables in the final dataset under the assumption that
they will be relevant in the highly non-linear ML models. An initial
analysis was done on the S\&P 500 data after April 20th 1982 because
opening and closing prices are differentiated between from that date
onwards. This analysis found a large array of significant variables --
more than half the days of the month, the month of September, a few
specific years, 10 non-consecutive lags and the first lag of volume of
trade. The significance of these variables, particularly the days of the
month were difficult to explain rationally. However, they did indicate
persistence of volatility. This volatility persistence and the fact that
volume is a strong indicator of absolute price change encouraged a
second round of analysis that was done on all data following the initial
recording of volume in 1950. This second round of analysis was focused
on finding an auto-regressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
model that fit the data well. The analysis concluded with the selection
of an ARMA (2,0) GARCH (1,1) model. Thus, the auto-regressive variables
selected for inclusion in the final data set are the first and second
lags of the demeaned log difference between consecutive closing prices
(DlogDif), the first lag of the absolute DlogDif (absDlogDif\_1) as a
pseudo-variance measure and the first lag of standardized volume of
trade controlled for date trend (stdVol\_1DateResid) as a second
pseudo-variance measure.

\hypertarget{onwards}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{1982 onwards
\label{1982}}{1982 onwards }}\label{onwards}}

Running time series analysis on the daily percentage change in the S\&P
500 after April 20th 1982 revealed 10 significant non-consecutive lags.
The `Daily percentage change' variable was created by taking the
percentage difference between the `Close' and `Open' variables for each
day of the data. Before April 20th 1982 the `Open' and `Close' variables
hold identical values, hence the time series analysis only being run
after that date. `Daily percentage change' is naturally stationary. This
is supported by the results of an Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test
which indicated that no unit root is present in the data. Running a
partial autocorrelation function revealed 10 significant lags (these
were lagged by 1, 2, 4, 12, 15, 16, 18, 27, 32, and 34 periods,
respectively). Regressing `Daily percentage change' on all 10
significant lags reinforced the finding by yielding significance above
the 95\% confidence interval for all 10 lags. Further, regressing the
daily percentage change on weekday, monthday, month and year categorical
variables yielded an array of significant correlations across the
monthday, month and year categories (none of the weekdays were
significant). Regressing on the categorical variables and the lags
simultaneously yielded similar results with increased significance for
2002 (to the 99\% level) and 2008 (to the 99,9\% level) and the addition
of 2018 (significant at the 95\% level), further an extra 4 monthdays
were deemed significant - bringing the total to 21 (out of 31)
significant monthdays, finally, some of the significance levels on the
lags changed. Adding a normalized (distributed standard normal) volume
variable lagged by one period to the regression yields a significance at
the 99\% level on the lagged volume variable and reduces alters the
significance on the year variables.

While the years 2002 and 2008 are justifiable as significant because of
the financial crashes that happened in each of those years (2002 dot com
bubble and 2008 housing bubble) and September is also relatable to the
housing bubble; it is difficult to rationally justify the monthday
variables as significant regardless of their quantitative significance.
The high number of lags is also difficult to justify and implies rather
that there may be persistence of volatility. Thus, the following section
focuses on the modelling of volatility over a time period that maximises
the inclusion of volume statistics in the data. All of the analysis
reported in this section was done in R\footnote{The primary packages
  used were `stats', `tidyverse', `ggplot2' and `fixest'.} (Marais,
2022).

\hypertarget{onwards-arch-model}{%
\subsubsection{1950 onwards -- ARCH model}\label{onwards-arch-model}}

A second round of time series analysis was performed on all the data
after Jan 1st 1950 which revealed that an ARMA(2,0) GARCH(1,1) model
might be the most appropriate linear fit to the data and that the first
lag on a date controlled version of standardized volume is a good
predictor of logDif. The secondary analysis was performed because the
number (and non-consecutiveness) of significant lags in the first model
was out of the ordinary. The choice was made to extend the dataset back
to 1950 because lagged volume appeared to be significant and volume data
is available from that time onwards.

The extended dataset required a different dependent variable because
open and closing prices were only differentiated between after April
20th 1982. Thus, the inter-day log difference in closing price
constituted the dependent variable in the second round of analysis.
Figure \ref{Figure4} depicts the logDif from 1950 until present -- the
persistence of volatility is made apparent by the intermittent spikes.
Figure \ref{Figure5} illustrates the correlation between the logDif and
standardized volume which justifies the extension of the dataset.
Further the logDif auto-regression results depicted in Table \ref{Reg 1}
and the categorical regression results depicted in Table \ref{Reg 2}
align with the regression results presented in section \ref{1982} and
further suggest persistent volatility exists in the logDif series.

\hypertarget{volume}{%
\paragraph{Volume}\label{volume}}

Regressing the logDif on the first lag of standardized volume yielded
insignificant results. However, regressing absolute logDif
(pseudo-volatility) on the first lag of standardized volume (stdVol\_1)
yielded a coefficient of 0,148 significant above the 99,9th percentile.
Figure \ref{Figure6} shows this relationship. Figure 6 also shows that
standardized volume (stdVol) trends upwards over time. Further,
regressing stdVol\_1 on Date (regression 6) yields a positive
coefficient significant above the 99,9th percentile and an adjusted R2
of 0,6. This shows that a large percentage of the variation in stdVol is
explained by variation in Date. Thus to avoid implicitly including a
Date proxy\footnote{The goal of this project is to create a model that
  can predict future S\&P 500 returns. Thus, to include a proxy for date
  (in this case in the date trending stdVol) would cause data
  contamination since dates do not hold any information relevant to the
  S\&P 500 returns besides price or volatility trends.} as a predictor
of S\&P 500 returns the included volume variable must be adjusted to be
stationary over time. The residuals from regression 6 make up the
variation in stdVol that cannot be explained by the variation in Date --
thus they are a Date neutral measure of stdVol. Figure \ref{Figure7}
shows the difference between stdVol and stdVol controlled for variance
due to Date (stdVolControlled). Regressing the residuals of regression 6
on Date (regression 7) shows no significant relationship between the two
while regressing absolute logDif on the residuals from regression 6
(regression 8) yields a coefficient of 0,164 significant above the
99,9th percentile. Figure \ref{Figure8} shows the relationship between
absolute logDif and stdVolControlled. Thus these residuals (rather than
stdVol) should be included as a variable in the final prediction data.

\hypertarget{arch-and-garch-testing}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{ARCH and GARCH testing
\label{ARCHandGARCH}}{ARCH and GARCH testing }}\label{arch-and-garch-testing}}

The LJung-Box test is a standard inference test in time series analysis.
It tests the null-hypothesis that a series is a white noise series
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hassani2020selecting}{Hassani \& Yeganegi,
2020}). Selection of the number of lags to be included in the Ljung-Box
test is discussed by Hassani \& Yeganegi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hassani2020selecting}{2020}). Critical to this
decision is the ratio of lags (H) to the number of observations (T) in
the data set. If the size of H is too large the actual size of the test
exceeds the nominal size of the test and the integrity of the test is
violated. The dataset for this set of tests contains 18143 observations.
The smallest (most difficult to satisfy) ratio permitted in the
discussion is 0,001 suggested by Hyndman \& Athanasopoulos
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hyndman2018forecasting}{2018}). Thus the maximum
number of lags that satisfy the smallest H/T ratio is 18 and any number
of lags less than 18 is permissible.

Running a 10-Lag LJung Box test on the logDif yields a p-value of 0.0002
which indicates that the null hypothesis should be rejected and that the
series is not a white noise series. I.e. ARCH effects are present in the
series. Running autocorrelation and partial-autocorrelation tests on the
absolute logDif indicates that there is a degree of persistence of
volatility (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kotze2021volatility}{KotzÃ©, 2021}).
This can be seen in Figure \ref{Figure9}. A t-test indicates that the
mean of the population is significantly different from zero (0.036).
Thus, demeaning the equation constitutes the construction of a mean
equation (essentially the demeaned logDif) represented in the series --
a demeaned daily percentage change(DlogDif)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kotze2020univariate}{KotzÃ©, 2020}). A 10 lag
Ljung-Box test again indicates the presence of ARCH effects specifically
in the 1st,2nd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th lags. However, running a multiple
linear regression (OLS) of DlogDif on its lags reveals only the 2nd,
6th, 8th and 9th lags as significant above the 95th percentile.

Eight models were tested for performance considering the above results.
Model 1 is an ARIMA(0,0,1), model 2 is an ARIMA(1,0,0), model 3 is an
ARMA(1,0) GARCH(1,1), model 4 is a GARCH(1,1), model 5 is an
EGARCH(1,1), model 6 is an ARMA(1,0) ARCH(1,0), model 7 is an ARCH(1,0)
and model 8 is an ARMA(2,0) GARCH(1,1). The inclusion of an EGARCH model
is motivated by its use in Nelson (1991), Blazsek \& Mendoza (2016) and
Tiwari, Raheem \& Kang (2019) in their time series analyses of the S\&P
500. Table \ref{Table 3} compares the coefficients from the 6 ARCH model
variations (models 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). Figure 10, 11 and 12, 13, 14
and 15 show the results of autocorrelation and partial-autocorrelation
functions of the residuals of the 6 ARCH variation models. Notably, all
three of the models that do not contain an ARMA(1,0) component (models
4,5 and 7) yield a significant first residual indicating that inclusion
of the ARMA(1,0) component is important. However, all the models
containing an ARCH(1,0) - besides model 6 - component yield a
significant second residual. Further, model 6 -- the non-generalized
ARCH model -- has intermittent significant residuals indicating that
volatility is clustered and persistent. Persistent volatility is one of
the oversights of the ARCH model that is addressed in the GARCH model.
As can be seen, Model 8 (Figure \ref{Figure15}) yields the least
significant residuals and as such has been selected as the model that
best fits this time series. The model linearly predicts the dependent
variable using the first and second lags of the dependent variable, the
first residual of an ARMA(1,0) model and the first lag of variance in
the time series (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kotze2020univariate}{KotzÃ©,
2020}). As such the first and second lags of DlogDif and both the the
first lag of the absolute DlogDif (absDlogDif\_1) and the first lag of
standardized volume of trade controlled for date trend
(stdVol\_1DateResid) as a pseudo-variance measures.

\hypertarget{additional-variables}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Additional variables
\label{addVars}}{Additional variables }}\label{additional-variables}}

Four additional auto-regressive variables were included to bolster the
information available to the algorithms under the assumption that the
linear modelling completed here is insufficient to exhaustively extract
useful variables. To account for persistence in positive or negative
momentum, such as in an EGARCH model, a positive and negative transform
variable was created. The mean of the positive entries in the DlogDif
variable was juxtaposed with the mean of the negative entries to create
a ratio of 1:-1.05 for positive to negative entries. Thus, where DlogDif
is negative posNegTransform is -1.05 and where posNegTransform is
positive posNegTransform is 1. Another three variables were added to
account for persistence in extreme price movements such as occured in
the 2002 or 2008 financial crises. These are blackSwan\_SD3,
blackSwan\_SD4 and blackSwan\_SD5. They are dummy variables set to 1
where the DlogDif variable lies outside 3, 4 or 5 standard deviations
from the mean of the series, respectively. Notably, all 3 black swan
variables and the posNegTransform are lagged by one period. Thus another
4 auto-regressive variables are added to the dataset.

Further, five S\&P 500 adjacent indicators were selected for this study.
The five series included were the NASDAQ composite index, the oil price,
the Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index (SSE), the Dollar strength
index and the CBOE volatility index (VIX). These variables are dubbed
`meta-data'.

\hypertarget{summary-of-data-collection-and-preparation}{%
\subsection{Summary of data collection and
preparation}\label{summary-of-data-collection-and-preparation}}

The data preparation phase of this project consisted of four sections.
These were, data collection, data cleaning, text data feature
engineering and financial data feature engineering. Data collection and
cleaning consisted of web scraping, removing HTML tags, converting to
lowercase, stopword removal and lemmatization for the text data.
Collection of the financial data is a done via a Python script that will
always download the entire history of the S\&P 500. Cleaning requires
only the removal of the adjusted close variable. Text data feature
engineering took the form of TextBlob sentiment analysis, VADER
sentiment analysis, Word2Vec vectorization and Doc2Vec vectorization.
The results of which were 2 sentiment descriptors from TextBlob, 4
sentiment descriptors from VADER, a 200 element average descriptor
vector from Word2Vec, a 200 and a 20 element vector speech descriptor
from Doc2Vec for the speech-centered data, and two 21 element vector
speech descriptors from Doc2Vec for the date-centered data for a total
of 426 variables (features) engineered from the text data for the
speech-centered data and 42 variables engineered from the text data for
the date-centered data. The financial data analysis took the form of
time series econometrics. This analysis resulted in the fitting of an
ARMA(2,0) GARCH(1,1) model to the engineered daily percentage change
variable. The model linearly predicts the dependent variable using the
first and second lags of the dependent variable, the first residual and
the first lag of variance in the time series. Thus the first and second
lags of logDif, the first lag of stdVol\_1DateResid and the first lag of
absDlogDif are included in the data. Thus 4 variables (features) have
been engineered using time series analysis of the S\&P 500 data.
Additionally, a further four auto-regressive variables were added to
make up for the flaws inherent in purely linear modelling and six S\&P
500 adjacent variables were also selected for addition to the dataset.

\hypertarget{experiment-design}{%
\section{Experiment design}\label{experiment-design}}

Two sets of experiments were run on two categories of data design. The
first is a speech-centered design. For every speech in this dataset
there is a row of data attached. Thus there is no data for dates when no
speeches occurred and there are duplicate dates because there are days
when more than one speech occurred. This dataset is the larger of the
two datasets and contains 35 251 rows of data -- one for each unique
speech since 1998-01-01.

Based on the assumption that every speech that occurs on a day affects
the closing price of the S\&P 500 on that day - the second dataset uses
a date-centered design. For every date (trading day) there is one row in
the dataset. Thus on dates when more than one speech occurred the speech
data has been aggregated into a single vector (see section \ref{Doc2Vec}
for an explanation of this method). The date-centered dataset contains
25 383 rows of data -- one for each trading day between 1950-01-01 and
2022-03-22. Notably, the meta-data is not included in this dataset
because two types of test data are included and the decision was taken
to focus on them. The speech-centered and date-centered datasets are
exemplified in Table \ref{Speech_center} and \ref{Date_center},
respectively.

Note that for the speech-centered data design there is no data for dates
that no speeches occurred and that there are duplicate dates. Note also
that on dates where more than one speech occurred there is duplicate
data in the LD\_Date\_Resid\_1 column which is representative of the
auto-regressive data in this example. Finally, note that the V1 and V2
columns (representative of the vectorized speech data) is different for
every row of data.

Next, note that for the date-centered data design every consecutive
trading day is included in the data. Note also that on days when no
speeches occurred the V1 and V2 (representing vectorized speech data)
from the last date that a speech occurred are duplicated and the number
of days since the last speech is recorded. Finally, note that on days
when multiple speeches occurred there is only one row of data --
i.e.~the speeches are amalgamated into a single vector.

For the speech-centered dataset a total of 1152 models were tested.
These consisted of 384 regression tasks and 768 classification tasks.
While for the date-centered data 336 models were tested. These consisted
of 112 regression models and 224 classification models. The models were
selected by incrementally altering a single hyperparameter across 5
fields for regression and 6 fields for classification. These fields are
detailed in the following sections.

\hypertarget{regression-fields}{%
\subsection{Regression fields}\label{regression-fields}}

The 5 fields of hyperparameters for regression were StartDates,
Remove\_duplicates, Reg\_Types, Reg\_algos and Datasets. StartDates
refers to the date from which the dataset began: 1998-01-01, 2000-01-01
and 2010-01-01. The 1998 dataset runs from 1998-01-01 until 2022-03-22,
the 2000 dataset runs from 2000-01-01 until 2022-03-22 etc.

The Remove\_duplicates field divides the speech-centered data into two
subsets -- one with all the duplicate dates removed and one including
the duplicate dates. Duplicate dates occurred because some speeches
occurred on the same date. This hyperparameter is necessary because the
Meta and Auto datasets only contain one value in each field -- thus
duplicating dates duplicates Meta and Auto data which creates the risk
of data contamination between the train and test sets. This field is not
valid for the date-centered data-subset and is set to `False' for all
the models using it.

The Reg\_Types field contains two options, TS\_Regressor and
CS\_Regressor. These refer to the manner in which the data is split for
cross validation. The TS\_Regressor cross validation method splits the
data into 5 time-consecutive subsets using the `TimeSeriesSplit' out of
sample (OOS) method from scikit-learn. Model training is done on the
first subset, then the first and second subset etc. up until the fourth
subset. Training scores are calculated for each of the four training
subsets and the maximum score is passed forward as the final
representation of the training score. Test scores are calculated for
only the fifth (and latest) split. This method is employed to force the
algorithm to perform prediction instead of interpolation. It avoids
giving the models access to the future of a data trend when making
predictions for a data point. However, the method is not strictly
necessary in this case because the dependent variable has been centered
and is close to normally distributed -- i.e.~it does not have a trend
(Bergmeir, Hyndman \& Koo, 2018). The CS\_Regressor option performs
regular 5-fold cross validation.

The Reg\_algos field refers to the four different ML algorithms
available for training. These are stochastic gradient descent, a 3
hidden layer neural network, multiple linear regression and gradient
boosting. The hyper-parameters for each of these fields can be found in
Appendix B.1.

Datasets is a complicated field. There are three groups of prediction
sub-datasets in the speech-centered dataset -- the control subset:
X\_control ; the meta subset: X\_meta ; and the test subset: X\_test.
X\_control contains the auto-regressive variables described in section
\ref{ARCHandGARCH} and \ref{addVars}, X\_meta contains the meta
variables (also described in section \ref{addVars}) and X\_test contains
the variables of focus -- the NLP variables. However, in total there are
458 variables across these three subsets. The X\_test subset makes up
the majority of this. There are 4 variables derived from the VADER
sentiment analysis, 2 variables from the TextBlob sentiment analysis,
200 variables from Word2Vec, 200 variables from Doc2Vec\_200 and 20
variables from Doc2Vec\_20.

In order to minimize training times and redundancy the X\_test dataset
was reduced to contain 26 variables. These are the VADER and TextBlob
sentiment scores and the Doc2Vec\_20 word embeddings. The Word2Vec
embeddings were dropped after underperforming in a series of prediction
tasks when compared with the Doc2Vec embeddings. The Doc2Vec\_20 and
Doc2Vec\_200 embeddings performed similarly on the prediction tasks and
combining them did not improve performance. Thus, to minimize the number
of variables the ML-models had to contend with, the Doc2Vec\_20
embeddings were kept.

The date-centered dataset also contains three groups of prediction
subsets. These are the same X\_control dataset as in the speech-centered
data, and two versions of the vectorised speech data -- the distributed
bag of words (DBOW) subset and the distributed memory (DM) subset --
both detailed in section \ref{Doc2Vec}. A detailed description of the
variables available and tested is available in Appendix B.3.

All 8 X\_control variables were included in both the speech-centered and
the date-centered datasets. The final X\_meta variables selected were
Nasdaq\_ld\_1, Oil\_ld\_1, SSE\_ld\_1, USDX\_ld\_1 and VIX\_ld\_1. The
final X\_test variables selected were the VADER scores, the TextBlob
scores and the set of 20 Doc2Vec variables. While the DBOW and DM
datasets each contained all 20 of their variables and the number of days
since the last speech. The datasets field provided the option for any
combination of each data designs' three subsets as training variables
for a sum of 7 combinations each. Additionally a PossibleBest set of
variables was selected for the speech-centered dataset using an elastic
net regression algorithm from scikit-learn (hyperparameters available in
appendix B). It was decided to create a 10 variable dataset using 4 NLP
variables, 3 control variables and three meta variable. The elastic net
selected DlogDif\_1, DlogDif\_2, pos\_neg\_transform, Nasdaq\_ld\_1,
Oil\_ld\_1, VIX\_ld\_1, DV\_20\_6, DV\_20\_8, DV\_20\_13, DV\_20\_15 as
the most prominent variables in each of the three subsets of variables.
The elastic net regressions are depicted in Figures \ref{Figure16},
\ref{Figure17} and \ref{Figure18}.

\hypertarget{classification-fields}{%
\subsection{Classification fields}\label{classification-fields}}

The 5 fields of hyperparameters for classification were StartDates,
Remove\_duplicates, Binary, Clf\_Types, Clf\_algos and Datasets.
StartDates, Remove\_duplicates and Datasets are identical to their
equivalents in the regression section above.

Binary refers to the Y-variable (classification fields) being predicted.
The options for Binary are True and False. If False is selected the
continuous Y-variable is split into 8 categories denoted by the numbers
1-8. These categories represent a number of standard deviations from the
mean of the input Y-variable. See Equation \ref{eq1}. If Binary is set
to True then the Y-variable is split into 2 categories denoted by 1 and
0 which indicate whether the entry is above or below the mean of the
continuous Y variable. See Equation \ref{eq2}.

\begin{align} 
Ycat=   \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll} 
      1  &\text{where } \mu-2\sigma>Ycont \label{eq1} \\
      2  &\text{where } \mu-\sigma>Ycont>\mu-2\sigma \\
      3  &\text{where } \mu-0.5\sigma>Ycont>\mu-\sigma \\
      4  &\text{where } \mu>Ycont>\mu-0.5\sigma \\
      5  &\text{where } \mu<Ycont<\mu+0.5\sigma \\
      6  &\text{where } \mu+0.5\sigma<Ycont<\mu+\sigma \\
      7  &\text{where } \mu+\sigma<Ycont<\mu+2\sigma \\
      8  &\text{where } \mu+2\sigma<Ycont \\
\end{array} 
\right. 
\end{align} \[
where \ \sigma = standard \ deviation \ of \ Ycont \ and \ \mu = mean \ of \ Ycont
\]

\begin{align}
Ycat=   \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll} 
      1  &\text{where } Ycont>\mu \label{eq2} \\
      0  &\text{where } Ycont<\mu \\
\end{array} 
\right. 
\end{align} \[
where \ \sigma = standard \ deviation \ of \ Ycont \ and \ \mu = mean \ of \ Ycont
\] Clf\_Types refers to the Time Series cross validation and
Cross-section cross validation methods as described in the regression
section. The options in this category are CS\_Classifier and
TS\_Classifier. Clf\_algos is very similar to the Reg\_algos field
described in the previous section. The algorithms available for
classification are stochastic gradient descent, a 3 hidden layer neural
network, logistic regression and gradient boosting. The hyper-parameters
for each of these fields can be found in Appendix B.2.

\hypertarget{results-and-discussion}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Results and discussion
\label{results}}{Results and discussion }}\label{results-and-discussion}}

The results of the model tests indicated that U.S. Presidential Speeches
hold at least a small amount of predictive power over movements in the
S\&P 500 stock index. This conclusion was deduced from the fact that the
best performing datasets in both the date-centered classification
analysis and the date-centered regression analysis included vectorized
speech data. It is also corroborated by the consistent appearance of
speech subset inclusive data in the best performing models across both
data design types, and both classification and regression tasks.

Models trained on the date-centered dataset outperformed models trained
on the speech-centered dataset by about 2 percentage points
(\textasciitilde0,58 vs \textasciitilde0,6) on the test set accuracy
score for binary classification analysis. Models using the date-centered
dataset also achieved lower MAE's than models trained and tested on the
speech-centered dataset. Interestingly, an implication of the superior
performance of the (smaller) date-centered dataset is that data with
high quality has outperformed data with high quantity. The section below
explains the results in more detail.

\hypertarget{speech-centered-classification-analysis}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Speech-centered classification analysis
\label{speech-centered}}{Speech-centered classification analysis }}\label{speech-centered-classification-analysis}}

Analysing the best performing classification models, in terms of test
set accuracy, across all categories of the speech-centered data reveals
a very high likelihood of data contamination in the data containing
duplicate dates. All ten of the top performers are on data containing
duplicates and the accuracies range from 0,72 to 0,80. It is highly
unlikely that these models have managed to achieve 80\% accuracy in
prediction of detrended S\&P 500 on unseen data over a 52 year period.
Thus results of classification models trained and tested on duplicate
date containing data is discarded henceforth.

Analysis of the performance of the remaining (duplicates removed) data
revealed that the best performing models were trained on the binary
cross-sectional data from 2010 onward. Of the duplicate removed results
the top ten performers contain seven models trained and tested on the
2010 dataset -- including the top four. Further, eight of the top ten
models performed binary classification. Finally seven of the ten were
trained on cross-sectional cross validation. Thus further analysis took
place within the binary, cross-sectional and 2010 categories.

Having reduced the data to just the cross-sectional binary data from
2010 onward - test set accuracy ranges from 0,54 to 0,58. The mean of
the target variable is \textasciitilde{} 0,5 and thus every model in the
top ten models outperforms chance (recall that the target variable is
binary). Six of the ten best models were trained on data including NLP
data, while only five of the best models were trained on auto-regressive
inclusive data. Meta data was included in eight of them. Notably an
NLP-only (gradient boosting) model ranks fourth with a test set accuracy
of 0,56. This constitutes evidence of the predictive power of US
Presidential speeches over S\&P 500 movements and lends credibility to
the hypothesis of this project.

\hypertarget{date-centered-classification-analysis}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Date-centered classification analysis
\label{Date-centered classification}}{Date-centered classification analysis }}\label{date-centered-classification-analysis}}

The means of both the full set of 1950 binary Y's and the test set of
1950 binary Y's are maintained at \textasciitilde{} 0,5. This implies
that any accuracy above 0,5 beats chance. The top ten models in the
date-centered classification task achieved test set accuracies between
0,57 and 0,59 and therefore all outperformed chance. All of these ten
models were trained on the full range of data - i.e.~the 1950 subset.
They were also all trained using time-series validation - the TS subset.
Seven of the best models were trained on NLP-inclusive data (five DBOW
and 2 DM inclusive sets) and all of the ten best models were trained on
auto-regressive inclusive data.

Notably, the date-centered dataset initially outperforms the (duplicate
removed) speech-centered dataset by 2 percentage points at the bottom of
the range and 1 percentage point at the top of the range in terms of
test set classification accuracy. Because of this, the models trained on
the date-centered dataset were optimized for maximum performance.
Log-regression is initially the best performing classifier in the TS
section generally, taking the top two and the seventh positions.
However, the models trained on the AutoDBOW dataset outperform the
models trained on the Auto only dataset in the Binary NN and the Binary
Gradient Boosting categories. Thus, these three models were selected for
optimization.

\hypertarget{optimization-of-classification-models-for-ts-classification-of-date-centered-data}{%
\subsubsection{Optimization of classification models for TS
classification of date-centered
data}\label{optimization-of-classification-models-for-ts-classification-of-date-centered-data}}

The training set accuracy on the 1950 binary AutoDBOW for the gradient
boosting classifier was initially 77,5\% indicating that it may have
been slightly overfitting the training data. For the NN, the training
accuracy is 59\% which is similar to the test set accuracy and indicates
a good fit for the data. Grid search was manually performed to optimize
the NN and Gradient Boosting algorithms for the binary 1950 AutoDBOW and
Auto datasets.

After closer optimization of hyper-parameters it becomes clear that the
AutoDBOW dataset outperforms the Auto dataset on test score both overall
and across both the Stochastic Gradient Descent and Log Regression
trained models. The best performing algorithm for the AutoDBOW dataset
was the LogReg\_4 algorithm (please see appendix B.4 for
hyperparameters) which achieved a test set accuracy of 0,601 while the
best performing algorithm for the Auto dataset was the NN\_7 algorithm
which achieved a test set accuracy of 0,599. This difference indicates
that there is at least a slight benefit to including the DBOW dataset in
predictive data and corroborates the evidence presented in section
\ref{speech-centered}.

\hypertarget{speech-centered-regression-analysis}{%
\subsection{Speech-centered regression
analysis}\label{speech-centered-regression-analysis}}

All of the regression models trained on the speech-centered dataset
outperformed the series mean as predictors of the Y-variable
(logDif\_date\_resid) on the training, test and validation datasets. The
cross-sectional cross validation training method (CS data-subset)
outperformed the time-series cross validation method (TS data-subset).
The models trained on the duplicates removed data and the duplicates
inclusive data performed equally well. The gradient boosting trained
models performed best on the duplicate inclusive data while
neural-network trained models were the best performers in the duplicates
removed data. Models trained on NLP inclusive data-subsets performed
well across all the categories but did not outperform the exclusively
auto-regressive data-subsets. Finally, models trained on the duplicate
inclusive data-subset were dropped for risk of data contamination and
models trained on only the NLP data-subset were tested. These still
managed to outperform the series-mean as a predictor of the Y-variable
and this was taken as further evidence of the predictive power of the
NLP data.

The average mean absolute error (MAE) recorded across all 384 regression
models run was 0,87 for the training data, 0,95 for the test data and
0,8 for the validation data. Comparing these with a standard deviation
of 1,26 for the logDif\_date\_resid variable in the 1998 subset shows
that the average absolute error across all the regressions run lies
within one standard deviation of the dependent variable indicating that
the regressions are better predictors of the series than the mean of the
series. This also holds across each of the three date subsets (1998,
2000, and 2010).

The top ten performing models in regression tasks were all trained on
the cross-sectional 2010 dataset and achieved MAE's between 0,68 and
0,7. Interestingly, there was an even split between datasets with
duplicates removed and without. The best performer did not have
duplicates removed whilst the second, third and fourth best performers
did. Analysis of only duplicate-inclusive data trained models gave the
top four places to gradient boosting models trained on the AutoMeta,
All, Meta and Auto datasets (in that order). The MAEs for the top four
performers ranged from 0,68 to 0,7. NLP inclusive datasets ranked in
five of the top ten places. Analysis on the duplicates removed top ten
performers shows the NN taking 8 of the top ten places -- including the
top seven spots. NLP inclusive dataset trained models ranked well taking
the second, third, fourth, fifth and seventh spots but not beating the
purely auto-regressive data trained models.

It is difficult to draw a solid conjecture about the predictive power of
the NLP data from these mixed results. However, data contamination in
the duplicate inclusive dataset is likely and the results should be
discarded. Given the fair performance of the NLP inclusive datasets in
the duplicates removed dataset, at this point, it remains likely that
the NLP data holds predictive power.

A final analysis of all the regression models trained on only 1998 NLP
data from the speech-centered dataset shows that the top ten performing
models all achieved a MAE below 1,06. This is still below the standard
deviation of 1,26 for the 1998 Y variable (logDif\_date\_resid) and thus
indicates that regression models trained only on the NLP data outperform
the mean of the series as a predictor. This again corroborates evidence
that U.S. presidential speeches having predictive power over S\&P 500
movements.

\hypertarget{date-centered-regression-analysis}{%
\subsection{Date-centered regression
analysis}\label{date-centered-regression-analysis}}

In the date-centered regression analysis the models trained on the full
dataset (the 1950 subset) using the cross-section cross validation
method performed the best - achieving the lowest ten MAE's. These
clustered around 0,66 while the standard deviation for the test set was
0,96. Therefore these models are better predictors than the mean of the
series. Notably, the date-centered dataset has again outperformed the
speech-centered dataset. The best score was achieved by a model trained
on a NLP-only data-subset (DBOW) by an SGD algorithm. NLP-inclusive data
was used to train seven of the top ten performing models and three of
them only used NLP data. Notably, the AutoDM (NLP-inclusive) subset
outperformed the Auto (NLP-non-inclusive) subset in the NN model -
undeniably indicating the predictive power of the NLP data.

NN algorithms were responsible for six of the lowest ten MAEs and SGD
models were responsible for a further 3. The DBOW dataset appeared
twice, the Auto dataset 3 times, the DM dataset once, AutoDBOW twice,
AutoDM once and AutoBoth once. In total the Auto dataset appeared in 7
of the top ten performers, the DBOW appeared in 5 and the DM dataset
appeared 3 times. Given this and the predictive ability of the DBOW
shown in section \ref{Date-centered classification}, DBOW and Auto data
sets were compared across attempted optimizations of the NN and SGD
algorithms. However, no significant improvement could be engineered and
almost all models performed worse than the initial models. Given that
the best performing dataset in terms of test MAE was the DBOW dataset,
further evidence is presented that U.S. presidential speeches hold
predictive power over the S\&P 500.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

The core conclusion of the research presented here is that U.S
presidential speeches do hold predictive power over price changes in the
S\&P 500 index. This is exhibited by the improvement of accuracy in
predictive models gained from the inclusion of vectorized speech data.
Further, 2 more useful conclusions can be drawn from this research.
First, an ARMA(2,0) GARCH(1,1) model is the best linear model describing
the log difference of closing prices in the S\&P 500 and second, Doc2Vec
outperforms Word2Vec, VADER and TextBlob as a text vectorization method
when relating U.S. Presidential Speeches to fluctuations in the S\&P
500. This information should be useful to other researchers looking to
explore the relationship between text data and stock market movements as
well as traders who need to make informed decisions about the S\&P 500.

\hypertarget{further-research-avenues}{%
\section{Further research avenues}\label{further-research-avenues}}

Improvements in this research could be achieved by the addition of extra
variables and/or the exploration of more sophisticated machine learning
algorithms. Additional auto-regressive variables could have been
included in the control dataset. In particular, the first lag of the
residual of an ARMA (1,0) model and the prediction of an ARMA(2,0)
GARCH(1,1) may have increased predictive power of the control
data-subset (\protect\hyperlink{ref-aras2021stacking}{Aras, 2021}). More
powerful NLP techniques, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT), could also lead to more comprehensive
word-embeddings and better information transfer to the final ML
algorithms and better prediction results by extension. Other
improvements in the NLP component could come from using more
sophisticated methods of parameter selection such as that suggested by
Patel \& Bhattacharyya
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-patel-bhattacharyya-2017-towards}{2017}) for
embedding dimensions or the inclusion of more specific dictionaries such
as the emotion specific one presented in Widmann \& Wich
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-widmann_wich_2022}{2022}).

A lot more research could be done in the political science and
linguistic realms using the NLP component of the dataset. For example it
could be interesting to determine which presidents produced the most
similar speech vectors and if similarities in speech correlated with
similarities in policy decisions or voter behavior. Another example
could be creating a timeline of speech vectors and relating modern
influential speakers to time periods based on similarity in speech
vectors. Further economic research could be done into the macroeconomic
or macro-financial effects of certain types of speeches by simply
relating the speech vectors to other macro-indicators, such as long term
bond yields or GDP figures.

The full X\_control dataset contains 13 autoregressive variables from
the S\&P 500 daily closing price. These are:

â€¢ DlogDif -- the demeaned log difference of the S\&P 500 daily closing
price (this should be used as a dependent variable only)\\
â€¢ DlogDif\_1 -- the first lag of DlogDif\\
â€¢ DlogDif\_2 -- the second lag of DlogDif\\
â€¢ absDlogDif -- the absolute of DlogDif (this should be used as a
dependent variable only)\\
â€¢ absDlogDif\_1 -- the first lag of absDlogDif\\
â€¢ logDif -- the log difference of the S\&P 500 daily closing price
(dependent variable only)\\
â€¢ logDif\_date\_resid -- the residual of the regression of logDif on the
Date variable\\
â€¢ logDif\_date\_resid\_1 -- the first lag of logDif\_date\_resid\\
â€¢ blackSwan\_SD3\_1 -- a dummy variable that is set to 1 if the first
lag of the logDif\_date\_resid variable lies outside 3 standard
deviations from its mean and 0 otherwise\\
â€¢ blackSwan\_SD4\_1 -- the same as blackSwan\_SD3\_1 but for 4 standard
deviations\\
â€¢ blackSwan\_SD5\_1 -- the same as blackSwan\_SD3\_1 but for 5 standard
deviations\\
â€¢ stdVol\_1DateResid -- the first lag of the residual of standardized
volume regressed on the Date variable\\
â€¢ pos\_neg\_transform -- the first lag of a pseudo-dummy variable which
is set to 1 if DlogDif is positive and set to the ratio of the mean of
all negative DlogDifs to the mean of all positive DlogDifs

The full X\_meta dataset contains 12 adjacent financial variables that
may have correlation with S\&P 500 movements. These are:

â€¢ BTC\_ld\_1 -- the first lag of the log difference of the daily Bitcoin
closing price.\\
â€¢ BTC\_dr\_1 -- the first lag of the residual of the regression of the
Bitcoin closing price on the date.\\
â€¢ Nasdaq\_ld\_1 -- the first lag of the log difference of the daily
Nasdaq Composite Index closing price.\\
â€¢ Nasdaq\_dr\_1 -- the first lag of the residual of the regression of
the Nasdaq Composite Index closing price on the date.\\
â€¢ Oil\_ld\_1 -- the first lag of the log difference of the daily crude
oil closing price.\\
â€¢ Oil\_dr\_1 -- the first lag of the residual of the regression of the
crude oil closing price on the date.\\
â€¢ SSE\_ld\_1 -- the first lag of the log difference of the daily
Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index closing price.\\
â€¢ SSE\_dr\_1 -- the first lag of the residual of the regression of the
Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index closing price on the date.\\
â€¢ USDX\_ld\_1 -- the first lag of the log difference of the daily US
Dollar Index closing price.\\
â€¢ USDX\_dr\_1 -- the first lag of the residual of the regression of the
US Dollar Index closing price on the date.\\
â€¢ VIX\_ld\_1 -- the first lag of the log difference of the daily Chicago
Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index closing price.\\
â€¢ VIX\_dr\_1 -- the first lag of the residual of the regression of the
Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index closing price on the
date.

The full X\_test dataset contains 426 NLP variables extracted from the
US Presidential Speeches. 6 of these are generated by the VADER and
TextBlob sentiment analysis tools. They are:

â€¢ VaderNeg -- The negativity score generated using the VADER tool.\\
â€¢ VaderNeu -- The neutrality score generated using the VADER tool.\\
â€¢ VaderPos -- The positivity score generated using the VADER tool.\\
â€¢ VaderComp -- The compound score generated using the VADER tool. This
is a combination of the negativity, neutrality and positivity scores.\\
â€¢ blobPol -- The polarity score generated using the TextBlob tool.\\
â€¢ blobSubj -- The subjectivity score generated using the TextBlob tool.
The higher the score the more subjective a text is.

200 of these are generated using the Word2Vec text vectorization tool.
These variables do not contain specified meaning but are rather the
average of final parameters from hidden layers in neural networks
performing the pseudo-task of word prediction. Their purpose is to
relate words to each other depending on the context of each word within
the broader corpus. These are annotated as:

â€¢ WV\_0\\
â€¢ WV\_1\\
â€¢ \ldots{}\\
â€¢ WV\_198\\
â€¢ WV\_199

The final 220 variables are generated using the Doc2Vec text
vectorization tool. The Doc2Vec tool works similarly to the Word2Vec
tool except that during training a second hidden layer is incorporated.
This second layer is persisted across each word in a text in the
training corpus and its hyper parameters adjusted so as to create a
single vector describing the text as a whole. This tool was used to
create 2 sets of variables (each one a hidden layer from a pseudo-task).
These are a 200 variable set, annotated as:

â€¢ DV\_200\_0\\
â€¢ DV\_200\_1\\
â€¢ \ldots{}\\
â€¢ DV\_200\_198\\
â€¢ DV\_200\_199

and a 20 variable set, annotated as:

â€¢ DV\_20\_0\\
â€¢ DV\_20\_1\\
â€¢ \ldots{}\\
â€¢ DV\_20\_18\\
â€¢ DV\_20\_19

Two datasets and four models were focussed on during the hyper-parameter
tuning for in the TS Classification category. The two datasets were the
1950-01-01 AutoPVDBOW dataset and the 1950-01-01 Auto dataset. While the
model focus was on neural networks (NN) and gradient boosting (GB) for
the AutoPVDBOW dataset and on logistic regressions (Logreg) and
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for the Auto dataset. Only models that
yielded improvements in some score or another are included here. No
regression hyper-parameter tuning is reported here because the tuning
failed to improve the performance of the regression models.
